# Unity3D Script Reference Search
#### for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

## About
This is a Sublime Text 2 plugin allowing you to easily search the Unity3D Script Reference. 

Most of all it let's you right-click on any Unity Class or function and select 'Unity Class/Function Lookup' to open the Unity script reference page for that class or function.

The plugin code is based on the [WordPress Codex Search](https://github.com/welovewordpress/SublimeWordPressCodex) by welovewordpress 

## Usage
ctrl + shift + P and type `Unity`, or right click on any function and select 'Unity Class/Function Lookup'.

You can also select 'Search Unity Reference' to search the whole reference for the selected text.

Alternatively, you could create a custom key assignment in SublimeText.

## Install
-- This version not available through Package Control. If you choose to use this version, you will have to update the Unity3DScriptReference.py contents from the version avaiable on Package Control.
